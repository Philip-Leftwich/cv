This is a repository with the code I use to compile my CV. It is made with modified code of [Nick Strayer's datadrivencv package](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) using R [**pagedown**](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

Html version of my CV is available on [my website](https://kasia.codes/cv/), and [pdf](https://github.com/kzkedzierska/cv/raw/master/pdfs/kzkedzierska_cv.pdf) is stored in this repository. The shorter version of my CV, resume, is also available in [html](https://kasia.codes/resume/) and [pdf](https://github.com/kzkedzierska/cv/raw/master/pdfs/kzkedzierska_resume.pdf).
